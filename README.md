# One-pixel-attack
Implementation of the one pixel attack described in ["One pixel attack for fooling deep networks"](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.08864)  by Jiawei Su, Danilo Vasconcellos Vargas, Sakurai Kouichi.  
The structure of the code is inspired from this GitHub repository by [Dan Kondratyuk](https://github.com/Hyperparticle/one-pixel-attack-keras).

This was the final project for the Digital Forensics course, held in the academic year 2022-2023 at Univeristy of Padova, by prof. Simone Milani.
